Automatically take you through the CAC login process when you hit https://webmail.apps.mil

Normally when you go to the webmail page, you have to enter your username, click next, then click "sign in with CAC/PIV." This auto-fills the box for your email, when you click the button it will automatically click "Sign in with CAC/PIV." Just install it using debug mode; publishing 16 lines of code seems like overkill.
